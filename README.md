## Features ##

  * Exhaustive search for terminating turmites for a given set of parameters:
    * Number of states
    * Number of colors
    * Maximum movement from the starting point
    * Maximum number of steps
  * Square, hexagonal and triangular grids
  * N-dimensional searching for square/cubic/etc. grids
  * Can search for absolute-movement and relative-movement turmites on square and hex grids
  * Optimization by ignoring duplicate turmites, still lots more to do though.

## Results ##

This program found many the results collected here:

## Wishlist ##

  * Support for relative-movement turmites in 3D and higher.
  * More optimization, to extend the results.
